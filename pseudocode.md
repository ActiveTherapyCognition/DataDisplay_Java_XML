# **TotalPTConnect**

### **Questions**
1. What is the structure and naming convention of the array of objects coming from the back end?
2. Is it most efficient and practical to use MPAndroidCharts or draw the data to the screen without using a library? (Loading time)
3. What needs to be imported to draw to canvas manually?

### **Concept**
TotalPTConnect is a native android application that is written in Java using Android Studio.

### **MVP**
Build a Java class that accepts an array of objects, and displays data to the screen in the form of a bar graph.
